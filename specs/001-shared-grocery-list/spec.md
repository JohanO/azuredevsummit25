# Feature Specification: Shared Grocery List App

**Feature Branch**: `001-shared-grocery-list`  
**Created**: October 30, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build an app that can keep track of groceries to be bought. It should have a common list that can be shared between family members."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Add Items to Shopping List (Priority: P1)

A family member opens the app and adds grocery items to the shared list as they think of things needed. This is the core value proposition - capturing grocery needs as they arise.

**Why this priority**: Without the ability to add items, there's no list. This is the fundamental building block that delivers immediate value - family members can start tracking what they need to buy.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the app, adding multiple grocery items (e.g., "milk", "bread", "eggs"), and verifying they appear in the list. Delivers value by replacing paper notes or memory.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app is open, **When** a user types "milk" and adds it, **Then** "milk" appears in the grocery list
2. **Given** the list already has 3 items, **When** a user adds "bread", **Then** the list shows all 4 items including the new one
3. **Given** a user tries to add an empty item, **When** they submit, **Then** the system prevents adding blank entries
4. **Given** a user adds an item, **When** they view the list immediately after, **Then** the item appears without requiring a page refresh

### User Story 2 - Mark Items as Purchased (Priority: P1)

While shopping in the grocery store, a family member marks items as purchased to track what's been bought and what still needs to be collected.

**Why this priority**: Completes the basic shopping workflow. Without this, users can't track their progress through the store, defeating the purpose of having a list.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding items to a list, marking some as purchased, and verifying they're visually distinguished or removed. Delivers value by preventing duplicate purchases and tracking progress.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a list with 5 unpurchased items, **When** a user marks "milk" as purchased, **Then** "milk" is visually distinguished from unpurchased items
2. **Given** a user marks 3 of 5 items as purchased, **When** they view the list, **Then** they can clearly see 2 items remaining to buy
3. **Given** a user marks an item as purchased, **When** another family member views the list simultaneously, **Then** they see the updated status within 5 seconds
4. **Given** a user accidentally marks an item as purchased, **When** they tap it again, **Then** the item returns to unpurchased status

---

### User Story 3 - Share List with Family Members (Priority: P2)

A family member invites other household members to the grocery list so everyone can add items and see what's needed.

**Why this priority**: Enables the "shared" aspect requested in the feature description. Without this, it's just a personal list app. However, a single user can get value from P1 stories before sharing.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by one user creating a list, inviting a second user by entering their username/handle, and verifying both users can see and modify the same list. Delivers value by coordinating household shopping.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has a grocery list, **When** they invite another family member, **Then** the invited member receives a notification to join the list
2. **Given** a family member accepts an invitation, **When** they open the app, **Then** they see the shared grocery list with all current items
3. **Given** two family members share a list, **When** one adds an item, **Then** the other sees it appear in their view within 5 seconds
4. **Given** a user wants to share a list, **When** they view family members, **Then** they can see who currently has access to the list

---

### User Story 4 - Remove Purchased Items (Priority: P2)

After shopping is complete, a family member removes purchased items from the list to keep it clean and focused on what still needs to be bought.

**Why this priority**: Maintains list hygiene and prevents clutter. Important for long-term usability but not critical for initial shopping trips.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by marking items as purchased, then removing them, and verifying the list only shows unpurchased items. Delivers value by keeping the list focused and relevant.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a list has 3 purchased items and 2 unpurchased items, **When** a user removes all purchased items, **Then** only the 2 unpurchased items remain visible
2. **Given** a user removes an item, **When** another family member views the list, **Then** they don't see the removed item
3. **Given** a list has only purchased items, **When** a user removes all of them, **Then** the list shows as empty with a message encouraging them to add new items

---

### User Story 5 - Organize Items by Category (Priority: P3)

A family member groups items by store sections (produce, dairy, meat, etc.) to make shopping more efficient by reducing backtracking through the store.

**Why this priority**: Nice-to-have optimization that improves shopping efficiency but isn't essential for the core grocery tracking functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding items, assigning categories, and verifying they're grouped appropriately when viewing the list. Delivers value by reducing shopping time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user adds "milk" to the list, **When** they assign it to "Dairy" category, **Then** it appears under the Dairy section
2. **Given** a list has items in multiple categories, **When** a user views the list, **Then** items are grouped by category with clear section headers
3. **Given** a user hasn't assigned categories to some items, **When** they view the list, **Then** uncategorized items appear in an "Other" or "Uncategorized" section

### Edge Cases

- What happens when two family members add the same item simultaneously?
- How does the system handle when a user is offline and adds items?
- What happens when a family member removes another member's access to the shared list?
- How does the system handle very long item names (e.g., 200+ characters)?
- What happens when a user tries to share a list with someone who doesn't have the app installed yet?
- How does the system handle a list with hundreds of items?
- What happens when a family member is removed from the list but still has the app open?

### Key Entities

- **Grocery List**: Represents a collection of items to be purchased. Contains a name or identifier, creation date, and references to items and family members with access. A household typically has one active list but may have multiple lists over time.
- **Grocery Item**: Represents a single item to purchase. Contains a description/name, purchased status (yes/no), optional category, and timestamp of when it was added. Items belong to one list.
- **Family Member/User**: Represents a person with access to the app. Can create lists, add items, mark items as purchased, and share lists with other family members. A user can have access to multiple shared lists.
- **Category**: Represents a grouping for items (e.g., "Dairy", "Produce", "Meat"). Used to organize the shopping list by store sections. Categories can be predefined or user-created.
- **List Access**: Represents the relationship between a user and a grocery list, indicating who can view and modify which lists.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Family members can add a grocery item to the shared list in under 10 seconds from opening the app
- **SC-002**: Changes made by one family member appear on other family members' devices within 5 seconds when both are online
- **SC-003**: Users successfully complete their first shopping trip using the app (adding items, marking as purchased, removing items) with 90% task completion rate
- **SC-004**: The app remains usable with lists containing up to 100 items without performance degradation
- **SC-005**: 95% of list sharing invitations are successfully delivered and accepted within 24 hours
- **SC-006**: Users can access and modify their grocery list when offline, with changes synchronizing when connectivity returns
- **SC-007**: Zero data loss occurs when multiple family members edit the list simultaneously

## Assumptions

- Users have accounts or some form of identification to enable list sharing (authentication method to be determined)
- Users access the app from mobile devices (phones or tablets) as the primary use case is shopping in stores
- Family units typically consist of 2-8 members sharing a single grocery list
- A household maintains one active grocery list at a time (though the system may support multiple lists)
- Internet connectivity is available most of the time, but offline support is needed for stores with poor signal
- Standard grocery categories (Produce, Dairy, Meat, Bakery, etc.) are adequate for most users' organizational needs
- Users understand basic app interactions like tapping to mark items and swiping or tapping icons to delete items
- List sharing is typically done once during initial setup, not frequently
- Privacy is important - only explicitly invited family members should access the list
