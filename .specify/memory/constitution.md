# Azure Dev Summit 25 Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence
Code MUST be maintainable, readable, and follow established patterns. Every line of code is an investment in future productivity and team collaboration.

**Rules:**
- Code MUST pass linting and formatting checks before merge
- Functions MUST have single responsibilities and clear names
- Dependencies MUST be minimal and well-justified
- Code reviews MUST verify readability and maintainability

**Rationale:** Quality code reduces technical debt, enables faster feature development, and reduces bugs in production.

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Tests MUST be written before implementation code. No feature ships without comprehensive test coverage.

**Rules:**
- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation begins
- Unit tests MUST cover all business logic paths
- Integration tests MUST verify component interactions
- Contract tests MUST validate API boundaries
- Test coverage MUST exceed 80% for all new code

**Rationale:** Test-first development catches bugs early, guides design decisions, and provides confidence in refactoring.

### III. User Experience Consistency
User interactions MUST be predictable, accessible, and delightful across all touchpoints.

**Rules:**
- UI components MUST follow established design patterns
- Error messages MUST be clear and actionable
- Loading states MUST provide meaningful feedback
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) MUST be met
- User flows MUST be tested with real users

**Rationale:** Consistent UX reduces cognitive load, improves adoption, and ensures inclusive access.

### IV. Performance Standards
System performance MUST meet defined benchmarks and degrade gracefully under load.

**Rules:**
- API responses MUST complete within 200ms for 95th percentile
- Pages MUST load within 2 seconds on standard connections
- Memory usage MUST not exceed defined limits per component
- Performance tests MUST be automated and gate deployments
- Performance regressions MUST block releases

**Rationale:** Performance directly impacts user satisfaction and system scalability.

### V. Documentation & Observability
System behavior MUST be transparent and debuggable through comprehensive documentation and monitoring.

**Rules:**
- All public APIs MUST have complete documentation
- Error conditions MUST be logged with appropriate context
- Metrics MUST be collected for key user journeys
- Runbooks MUST exist for operational procedures
- Code MUST include inline documentation for complex logic

**Rationale:** Observable systems are easier to maintain, debug, and improve over time.

## Quality Gates

All code changes MUST pass these gates before merge:

- **Automated Tests**: All tests pass, coverage requirements met
- **Code Review**: At least one approved review from team member
- **Performance Check**: No regressions in key metrics
- **Security Scan**: No high or critical vulnerabilities
- **Documentation**: User-facing changes include documentation updates

## Development Workflow

### Pre-Development
1. Feature specification MUST be approved before development starts
2. Test scenarios MUST be defined and reviewable
3. Performance acceptance criteria MUST be established

### During Development
1. Feature branches MUST be used for all changes
2. Commits MUST be atomic and have descriptive messages
3. Tests MUST be written first and fail before implementation
4. Code MUST be reviewed before merge to main branch

### Post-Development
1. Features MUST be validated against original specifications
2. Performance MUST be measured and compared to benchmarks
3. Documentation MUST be updated to reflect changes
4. Deployment MUST include rollback procedures

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require:
1. Written proposal with rationale
2. Team consensus through discussion and approval
3. Migration plan for existing code where applicable
4. Updated documentation and training materials

All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Complexity that violates these principles MUST be justified with documented business need and simpler alternatives considered.
